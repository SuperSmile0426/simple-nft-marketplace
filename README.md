# Simple NFT Marketplace

This project provides sample codes to build a simple NFT marketplace with Amazon Managed Blockchain.
- AWS CDK to deploy backend API ([/provision](/provision))
- Contract written in Solidity ([/contract](/contract))
- Marketplace web UI ([/marketplace](/marketplace))

This sample code is not a complete marketplace. Some critical features have not been implemented. It is just a sample of simple NFT creation/transfer using Amazon Managed Blockchain. There is no function to set prices or buy/sell tokens. The only thing implemented is the transfer between accounts. Do NOT use this codes in your production workloads.
